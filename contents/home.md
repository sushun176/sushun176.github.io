I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and Technology at the School of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan Province. During my time at the university, I have consistently maintained a proactive learning attitude, solidly grasping professional theoretical knowledge and actively participating in various scientific research projects and practical activities. By participating in multiple research projects led by my supervisor, I have not only honed my scientific research abilities but also cultivated teamwork spirit and problem-solving skills. Additionally, I have utilized my spare time to participate in various academic competitions. These experiences have greatly broadened my horizons and enhanced my overall qualities. Furthermore, I am enthusiastic about participating in academic exchange activities, engaging in in-depth discussions with domestic and international experts and scholars, continuously absorbing cutting-edge knowledge, and laying a solid foundation for my academic development.
